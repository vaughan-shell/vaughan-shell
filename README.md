- 👋 Hi, I’m Vaughan
- 👀 I’m interested in ... FOSS, Linux, Space, and Politics(although I like to keep those out of discussions about other things)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about not really anything in particular, just trying to better understand linux and open-source programs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much, as I don't really know any programming languages, but feel free to ask me about something, even if I probabyl dont know the answer
- 📫 You can reach me at vflinux@protonmail.com
